# Punters Weather App

This web app has been created as part of the punters.com.au programming task.

We are required to use a modern front end framework (I have chosen React) to develop a single page web app
that is designed to search and fetch data from a remote
server and display that data in a way that is readable to a user.

I am using a 'fetch' method which returns a json object. This response is used to set the state of 'data' which is later rendered using the 'map' method to iterate through the object and display the results.

## Technology used

1. CORS chrome browser extension to add  'Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *'  to header
2. React
3. Babel to transpile code
4. Webpack to automate build
5. moment.js for date/time conversion
6. Git/Github pages for version control and hosting app


## Features that are still to be implemented

* Fix header
* Sort buttons
* Filter select box
* Improve styling
* Solve CORS problem
* Could abstract the individual components and use sass to style them
